# robochart-tests

This project contains RoboChart models used for testing the RoboTool plugins. It preserves the commit history of the relevant parts of the CSP generator repository.

## Possible changes

Perhaps we should consider making this a repository for tests for RoboTool, and include tests for RoboSim and p-models. In this case, we could tailore the Junit 
test and the testing scripts to identify the type of model by the file extensions.
